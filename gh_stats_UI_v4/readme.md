## Metrics and Calculations

The dashboard uses several key metrics to evaluate repository and contributor performance. Below are the most important calculations used throughout the dashboard. All of these metrics are derived directly from data in the Excel reports and calculated within the dashboard script.

### PR Health Score

The PR Health Score is a measure of pull request quality and efficiency. A PR is considered "healthy" if it meets both of these criteria:

1. It has been open for less than or equal to 7 days (configurable)
2. It has 2 or fewer labels (configurable)

PRs that don't meet these criteria are marked as "Needs Attention".

The Health Score calculation is:

```
Health Percentage = (Healthy PRs / Total PRs) * 100
```

The Health Status is determined by the Health Percentage:
- ğŸŸ¢: >= 80% (Good)
- ğŸŸ¡: >= 50% and < 80% (Moderate)
- ğŸ”´: < 50% (Poor)
- âšª: No PRs in the date range (Stable/No Dev)

#### Example:
If a repository has 20 total PRs with 16 healthy PRs:
- Health Percentage = (16 / 20) * 100 = 80%
- Health Status: ğŸŸ¢

If a repository has no PRs in the analyzed period:
- Health Percentage = 100% (default)
- Health Status: âšª (indicating Stable/No Dev)

### Repository Status Classification

Repositories are classified into different status categories:

- **Active Development**: Repositories with PRs in the analyzed period
- **Stable/No Development**: Repositories with no PRs in the analyzed period

This classification helps teams focus attention on repositories with active development while identifying codebases that are stable or not currently under development.

### PRs Approved by Contributor

This metric counts the number of pull requests that each contributor has approved as a reviewer. It helps identify contributors who actively participate in code review processes.

#### Calculation:
The dashboard counts the number of times a contributor's name appears in the "Approvers" list across all PRs.

#### Example:
If contributor "JaneDoe" appears as an approver in 12 different PRs:
- PRs Approved by JaneDoe = 12

### Change Requests Given by Contributor

This metric tracks how many change requests each contributor has submitted during code reviews. It helps identify contributors who actively enforce code quality standards.

#### Calculation:
The dashboard counts the number of times a contributor is recorded as having requested changes to a PR.

#### Example:
If contributor "JohnSmith" has requested changes in 8 different PRs:
- Change Requests Given by JohnSmith = 8

### PRs with Comments Percentage

This metric measures how many PRs receive meaningful review comments, which is an important indicator of code review quality:

```
PRs with Comments Percentage = (PRs With Comments / (PRs With Comments + PRs Without Comments)) * 100
```

#### Example:
If 30 PRs received comments during review and 10 PRs were approved without comments:
- PRs with Comments Percentage = (30 / (30 + 10)) * 100 = 75%

### Check Success Rate

The Check Success Rate measures the reliability of code in passing automated checks and tests:

```
Check Success Rate = (Passed Checks / (Passed Checks + Failed Checks)) * 100
```

#### Example:
If a repository has 150 passed checks and 30 failed checks:
- Check Success Rate = (150 / (150 + 30)) * 100 = 83.3%

### Average Calculations

The dashboard employs several averaging calculations to provide meaningful metrics across different dimensions:

#### Average PR Duration (Days)

This calculates the mean time PRs remain open:

```
Average PR Duration = Sum of PR Duration for All PRs / Total Number of PRs
```

#### Example:
If 5 PRs were open for 2, 4, 7, 3, and 9 days respectively:
- Average PR Duration = (2 + 4 + 7 + 3 + 9) / 5 = 5 days

#### Average Commits per Contributor

This measures the typical contribution volume per contributor:

```
Average Commits per Contributor = Total Commits Across All Repositories / Total Number of Contributors
```

#### Example:
If there are 800 total commits and 20 contributors:
- Average Commits per Contributor = 800 / 20 = 40 commits

#### Average PRs per Contributor

Similar to commits, this measures the typical PR creation rate:

```
Average PRs per Contributor = Total PRs Across All Repositories / Total Number of Contributors
```

#### Example:
If there are 120 total PRs and 20 contributors:
- Average PRs per Contributor = 120 / 20 = 6 PRs

#### Average PRs Approved per Contributor

This metric measures the typical code review participation rate:

```
Average PRs Approved per Contributor = Total PRs Approved Across All Contributors / Total Number of Contributors
```

#### Example:
If there are 200 total PR approvals and 20 contributors:
- Average PRs Approved per Contributor = 200 / 20 = 10 approvals

#### Average Change Requests per Contributor

This metric measures the typical code quality enforcement rate:

```
Average Change Requests per Contributor = Total Change Requests Given Across All Contributors / Total Number of Contributors
```

#### Example:
If there are 100 total change requests and 20 contributors:
- Average Change Requests per Contributor = 100 / 20 = 5 change requests

### Version Type Metrics

The dashboard analyzes version labels to categorize pull requests into different release types:

- **RC Versions**: Labels ending with '-rc' (Release Candidate)
- **NPD Versions**: Labels ending with '-npd' (Non-Production Deployment)
- **Stable Versions**: All other version labels

The distribution of these version types helps track the release cycle maturity across repositories.

### PR Age Distribution

PRs are categorized by age to analyze workflow efficiency:

- 1 day or less
- 1-3 days
- 3-7 days
- 7-14 days
- 14-30 days
- Over 30 days

This distribution helps identify bottlenecks in the review process. PRs that exceed the configurable threshold (default: 7 days) are marked as "Needs Attention".

### Contributor Performance Metrics

For each contributor, the dashboard calculates:

1. **Individual Health Score**: The percentage of a contributor's PRs that are healthy.
2. **Check Success Rate**: The success rate of all checks in a contributor's PRs.
3. **Multi-Repo Contribution**: The number of repositories a contributor is active in.
4. **Review Activity**: The number of PRs approved and change requests given by the contributor.

The dashboard now tracks all contributors, even those with no activity in the analyzed period, providing a comprehensive view of the contributor ecosystem.

### Contributor Activity Status

Contributors are classified with activity indicators:
- ğŸŸ¢: High health score (â‰¥80%) with active contributions
- ğŸŸ¡: Medium health score (â‰¥50%, <80%) with active contributions
- ğŸ”´: Low health score (<50%) with active contributions
- âšª: No activity in the analyzed period

### Multi-Repo Contributors Percentage

This metric shows what percentage of all contributors work across multiple repositories:

```
Multi-Repo Contributors Percentage = (Multi-Repo Contributors / Total Contributors) * 100
```

Where a Multi-Repo Contributor is defined as someone who has contributed to two or more repositories.

#### Example:
If there are 25 total contributors and 10 of them have contributed to multiple repositories:
- Multi-Repo Contributors Percentage = (10 / 25) * 100 = 40%

## Review Activity Metrics

The dashboard includes dedicated metrics to analyze code review participation:

### Total PRs Approved

This counts the total number of PR approvals across all contributors, providing insight into the overall review volume.

### Total Change Requests Given

This counts the total number of change requests submitted across all contributors, indicating the level of quality enforcement.

### Reviewer to Author Ratio

This metric helps evaluate if there is a healthy balance between code authorship and review participation:

```
Reviewer to Author Ratio = (Total PRs Approved + Total Change Requests Given) / Total PRs Created
```

#### Example:
If there are 300 PRs created, 250 PRs approved, and 100 change requests given:
- Reviewer to Author Ratio = (250 + 100) / 300 = 1.17

A ratio greater than 1.0 generally indicates a healthy review culture where there is more review activity than code authorship.

## FAQ

### How are PR health thresholds determined?

The default thresholds (7 days for duration, 2 for label count) are configurable in the GitHub Metrics Reporter script. They represent typical industry standards for efficient PR processing but can be adjusted based on your team's workflow.

### What does a low health score indicate?

A low health score could indicate several issues:
- PRs staying open too long without resolution
- Excessive use of labels, suggesting complex or poorly scoped PRs
- Process bottlenecks in the review workflow

### What does the "Stable/No Dev" status mean?

Repositories marked as "Stable/No Dev" had no PRs within the analyzed time period. This could indicate:
- A stable codebase that doesn't require active development
- A repository that is in maintenance mode
- A new repository that hasn't begun active development
- A deprecated repository that is no longer being developed

### How are contributors with no activity handled?

The dashboard now tracks all known contributors, even if they have no activity in the analyzed period. This provides:
- A complete picture of the contributor ecosystem
- Visibility into contributor churn or inactivity
- Historical context when contributors become active again

### How can we improve our metrics?

1. **Improve PR Health Score**:
   - Encourage smaller, well-scoped PRs
   - Implement a PR review SLA
   - Address PRs marked as "Needs Attention" promptly
   - Use standard label sets consistently

2. **Improve Check Success Rate**:
   - Address failed checks promptly
   - Improve test coverage and reliability
   - Conduct pre-commit testing

3. **Contributor Performance**:
   - Provide feedback based on individual metrics
   - Recognize high-performing contributors
   - Support contributors with lower metrics through mentoring

4. **Improve Review Activity**:
